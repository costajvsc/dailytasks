## About The Project

Dailytasks is a simple project to manager our tasks and do everything in our days. The scope is a CRUD feature using the best practices to code web application using framework [Laravel](https://laravel.com). This is a simple personal project and i use it to manager my daily and week.

### Here's why:
* Manager your tasks that you have do in your day.
* Code a simple project using Laravel Framework.
* Understand full cycle to schedule, implement, publish and improve a web application.
* Use this to show my abilities with programming and software development.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
